# DigitalTwinOfProduction
## Автоматизированное построение цифрового двойника производства

In this repository, an open source library is being developed, including LLM, which will analyze the documentation and conduct a survey of factory employees, combining this with the analysis of data from surveillance cameras to build a digital production twin. A multi-agent system designed for the automated construction of digital twins will be used. The library includes a constructor for building a digital twin, as well as recommendations for controlling production processes.
